- Support for interfaces other than Ethernet (SLIP, PPP, ...) Please coordinate
changes and requests with Leon Woestenberg <leon.woestenberg@gmx.net>
Integration with your code: In lwip/dhcp.h define DHCP_COARSE_TIMER_SECS
(recommended 60 which is a minute) define DHCP_FINE_TIMER_MSECS (recommended 500
which equals TCP coarse timer) Then have your application call dhcp_coarse_tmr()
and dhcp_fine_tmr() on the defined intervals. dhcp_start(struct netif netif);
starts a DHCP client instance which configures the interface by obtaining an IP
address lease and maintaining it. Use dhcp_release(netif) to end the lease and
use dhcp_stop(netif) to remove the DHCP client. /

DNS.C The lwIP DNS resolver functions are used to lookup a host name and map it
to a numerical IP address. It maintains a list of resolved hostnames that can be
queried with the dns_lookup() function. New hostnames can be resolved using the
dns_query() function. The lwIP version of the resolver also adds a non-blocking
version of gethostbyname() that will work with a raw API application. This
function checks for an IP address string first and converts it if it is valid.
gethostbyname() then does a dns_lookup() to see if the name is already in the
table. If so, the IP is returned. If not, a query is issued and the function
returns with a ERR_INPROGRESS status. The app using the dns client must then go
into a waiting state. Once a hostname has been resolved (or found to be non-
existent), the resolver code calls a specified callback function (which must be
implemented by the module that uses the resolver). / RFC 1035 - Domain names -

@file Dynamic memory manager This is a lightweight replacement for the standard
C library malloc(). If you want to use the standard C library malloc() instead,
define MEM_LIBC_MALLOC to 1 in your lwipopts.h To let mem_malloc() use pools
(prevents fragmentation and is much faster than a heap but might waste some
memory), define MEM_USE_POOLS to 1, define MEM_USE_CUSTOM_POOLS to 1 and create
a file "lwippools.h" that includes a list of pools like this (more pools can be
added between _START and _END): Define three pools with sizes 256, 512, and 1512
bytes LWIP_MALLOC_MEMPOOL_START LWIP_MALLOC_MEMPOOL(20, 256)

@file Packet buffer management Packets are built from the pbuf data structure.
It supports dynamic memory allocation for packet contents or can reference
externally managed packet contents both in RAM and ROM. Quick allocation for
incoming packets is provided through pools with fixed sized pbufs. A packet may
span over multiple pbufs, chained as a singly linked list. This is called a
"pbuf chain". Multiple packets may be queued, also using this singly linked
list. This is called a "packet queue". So, a packet queue consists of one or
more pbuf chains, each of which consist of one or more pbufs. CURRENTLY, PACKET
QUEUES ARE NOT SUPPORTED!!! Use helper structs to queue multiple packets. The
differences between a pbuf chain and a packet queue are very precise but subtle.
The last pbuf of a packet has a ->tot_len field that equals the ->len field. It
can be found by traversing the list. If the last pbuf of a packet has a ->next
field other than NULL, more packets are on the queue. Therefore, looping through
a pbuf of a single packet, has an loop end condition (tot_len p->len), NOT (next
NULL). / Copyright (c) 2001-2004 Swedish Institute of Computer Science. All

lwipopts.h If you don't use tcpip.c (so, don't call, you don't call tcpip_init):
- First, call autoip_init(). - call autoip_tmr() all AUTOIP_TMR_INTERVAL msces,
that should be defined in autoip.h. I recommend a value of 100. The value must
divide 1000 with a remainder almost 0. Possible values are 1000, 500, 333, 250,
200, 166, 142, 125, 111, 100 .... Without DHCP: - Call autoip_start() after
netif_add(). With DHCP: - define LWIP_DHCP_AUTOIP_COOP 1 in your lwipopts.h. -
Configure your DHCP Client. /

@file SNMP output message processing (RFC1157). Output responses and traps are
build in two passes: Pass 0: iterate over the output message backwards to
determine encoding lengths Pass 1: the actual forward encoding of internal form
into ASN1 The single-pass encoding method described by Comer & Stevens requires
extra buffer space and copying for reversal of the packet. The buffer
requirement can be prohibitively large for big payloads (> 484) therefore we use
the two encoding passes. / Copyright (c) 2006 Axon Digital Design B.V., The
